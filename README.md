# Employee Retention
Data challenge # 1 from Insight

## Goal:
Employee turn-over is a very costly problem for companies. The cost of replacing an employee
if often larger than 100K USD, taking into account the time spent to interview and find a
replacement, placement fees, sign-on bonuses and the loss of productivity for several months.
0t is only natural then that data science has started being applied to this area. Understanding
why and when employees are most likely to leave can lead to actions to improve employee
retention as well as planning new hiring in advance. This application of DS is sometimes called
people analytics or people data science (if you see a job title: people data scientist, this is your
job).

In this challenge, you have a data set with info about the employees and have to predict when
employees are going to quit by understanding the main drivers of employee churn.
